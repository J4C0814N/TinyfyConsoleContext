# TinyfyConsoleContext
Windows console app tied to a context menu item to tinify images from within Windows Explorer

Simple Windows Console app that uses the [TinyPNG API](https://tinypng.com/developers) to compress images from a Windows Explorer context menu item.
Simply:

1. Right-click an image or image selection
2. Select the Tinify context menu item
3. An [ImageName]-Tinified.[ext] image will be created in the same directory

# Still in very early stages of development. none of the above has been implemented :)
